# MAIS202
This repository is for the mcgill MAIS 202 challenge question.
"202.py" is the code
"home_ownership_data.csv" and "loan_data.csv" are the files given
"result.csv" is generated by my program and is the result of the question
"resultWithABarGraph.xlsx" has the same data as result.csv, except there is a bar graph
